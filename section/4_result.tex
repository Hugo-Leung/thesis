\section{Drell-Yan Cross Section Ratio}
\subsection{Results from Run 2-3 data}
\subsubsection{Effect of the updated target contamination correction}
\label{subsubsec:contamination_result}
As discussed in \cref{M-subsec:contamination}, an incorrect target contamination correction was used
in previous publications and the effect is shown in \cref{fig:contaimination_CSR}.
The overall effect is a roughly \SI{2}{\percent} shift in the ratio.

		cross section. The extracted cross section ratio using the revised target contamination
		is shown as red sold triangle, and the previous published version is shown as blue open
		circle. The overall effect is a roughly \SI{2}{\percent} shift in the ratio. }

\subsubsection{Choice of fit function in intensity extrapolation}
To understand the systematic uncertainties in the intensity extrapolation method due to the
choice of fit function, the following functions are used.
\begin{align}
	R_i\left(I\right) & = p_{0i} + p_{1} I + p_{2} I^2 \quad\text{(FIT 1)}                                                     \\
	R_i\left(I\right) & = p_{0i} + \left[p_{10} + p_{11}x_i\right] I + \left[p_{20} + p_{21}x_i\right]I^2 \quad \text{(FIT 2)}
\end{align}
The fit to data using the two fits are shown in \cref{fig:run2-3_FIT1_xT,fig:run2-3_FIT2_xT}
and $\chi^2$ for the fits are tabulated in \cref{tab:chi_run23}.
And the fit for other variables are listed in \cref{M-a_ch:extrapolation}.
\input{section/extrapolation_xT_23_1.tex}
\input{section/extrapolation_xT_23_2.tex}


\Cref{fig:CSR_Run2-3} shows the extracted cross section ratio as a function of $x_T$, $x_B$ and $x_F$.
While the two fit functions produce similar results for $x_T$, the differences are slightly larger in
the other variables.

\end{table}


\subsubsection{Comparison of massfit and extrapolation}
\Cref{fig:massfit_integrated_run23} shows the fit to the mass distributions for Run 2-3 data, and the
data is very well described by the fitting procedure.
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\begin{subfigure}{0.45\linewidth}

	\caption{The mass spectrum for \ce{LH_2}(left) and \ce{LD_2}(right) targets data for Run 2-3}
	\label{fig:massfit_integrated_run23}
\end{figure}

With the yield for different process obtained from the mass fits, the cross section ratios can be calculated
and are also shown in \cref{fig:CSR_Run2-3}.
As reported in Ref.~\cite{dove2023} the Drell-Yan cross section ratio as a function of $x_T$ extracted from
the two methods are in very good agreement.

However, the comparison in other variables, such as $x_B$ and $x_F$ are complicated by the large
systematical uncertainties originated from the fit function used in the intensity extrapolation.
\Cref{fig:CSR_Run2-3} shows the extracted ratios as a function of $x_B$ and $x_F$ using different methods.
While the massfit results agree with the extrapolation result if FIT 1 is used, the
extrapolation results using FIT 2 are different from the other two.

\subsection{Results from Run 5-6 data}
\Cref{fig:massfit_integrated_run56} shows the fit to the mass distributions for Run 5-6 data,
and the data is very well described by the fitting procedure.

\end{figure}
The Drell-Yan yield for $p+p$ and $p+d$ can then be extracted and the cross section ratio
is shown in \cref{fig:CSR_Run5-6}.

To extract the cross section ratio using the intensity extrapolation method, yield ratio
calculated as function of $x_T$ and intensity and the fits are shown in \cref{fig:run5-6_FIT1_xT}
(FIT 1) and \cref{fig:run5-6_FIT2_xT} (FIT 2), with the fits for other variables listed in
\cref{M-a_ch:extrapolation}. And the reduced $\chi^2$ is tabulated in \cref{tab:chi_run56}.
\input{section/extrapolation_xT_56_1.tex}
\input{section/extrapolation_xT_56_2.tex}
From the fits, the cross section ratio can be extracted.

\pdfmargincomment{run 5-6 compared with 2-3 and full data set, only show massfit results?}
\Cref{fig:CSR_Run5-6} shows the extracted cross section ratio as a function from the
second half of our data using various methods. While the different fit functions used in the
intensity extrapolation produce very similar results, the massfit result is significantly larger
than the intensity extrapolation results. This difference is included in the systematic uncertainties
for the final Drell-Yan cross section ratio from Run 5-6.

\end{table}

\subsubsection{Potential cause of difference between massfit and intensity extrapolation}
During the second half of the data taking, the variation in the instantaneous beam
intensity was reduced as compared to run 2-3. This is partly due to the improvement
in beam quality and partly due to the tightening of the beam inhibit thresholds.

The massfit and intensity extrapolation methods made different assumption on the intensity
and rate dependence. With less high intensity data, there are less constraints on the
intensity dependence, causing the two method to disagree.

\pdfcomment{Intensity range cannot explain the discrepancy }
\Cref{fig:CSR_combined} shows the final results from the two datasets. The two datasets
are consistent with each other, partly due to the large systematic uncertainties in the
Run 5-6 results, which is dominated by the differences between the massfit and intensity
extrapolation methods.

\subsection{Comparison with global PDF analysis}
\pdfmargincomment{modified to impact of SeaQuest result?}
The published $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ ratio result has been included in various recent global
PDF analysis, including Ref.~\cite{cocuzza2021,guzzi2022,accardi2023,alekhin2023}.
In particular, \cref{fig:CSR_Run2-3} shows the calculation using CT18 (without the SeaQuest data)
and NNPDF 4.0 (including the SeaQuest data). The shift in the cross section ratio is primarily
coming from the inclusion of the SeaQuest data. Unlike the previous E866 result, the SeaQuest data
strongly suggests the $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratio would remain greater than one for $x<0.4$, which is
consistent with prediction from various models, including meson cloud and statistical model.

The importance of the SeaQuest data can be seen in the NNPDF 4.0, where at large $x_T$,
uncertainties bands is consistent with the uncertainties of our measurements, as the SeaQuest
results is the only available data sensitive to the light sea-quark asymmetry at large $x$.

\subsection{Massfit results}
The massfits in all $x_F$ bins are shown in \cref{fig:massfit_57-70_xF,fig:massfit_5-6_xF},
and the fits in the $P_T$ bins are shown in \cref{fig:massfit_57-70_pT,fig:massfit_5-6_pT}.
The two datasets are analyzed separately. The data in each bin is very well described by the fitting procedure
and the $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$ yields can be extracted from the fits directly.

While the extracted $J/\psi$ cross section is in very good agreement with the NRQCD calculation,
the extracted $\psi'$
cross section disagree with the prediction, particular at large $x_F$. At large $x_F$ the NRQCD
calculation suggests the $\psi'$ should be dominated by the $q\bar{q}$ annihilation.
It is possible that the LDMEs used  for the $\psi'$ cross section calculation are not fully optimized,
and the $q\bar{q}$ annihilation is more important than suggested. This new result on the $\psi'$
cross section can be used in further constrain the LDMEs.

The ratios of $\sigma_{\psi'}/\sigma_{J/\psi}$ as a function of $x_F$ are also shown in \cref{fig:cs_xF_full}.
This ratio shows a clear $x_F$ dependence and increases at large $x_F$. In the NRQCD framework,
the difference in the $x_F$ distributions between $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$ is mostly originated
from the relative weighting between the different production subprocess.
In the CEM framework, the hadronization probability only depends on
the final charmonium state, but not the underlying subprocess. Therefore, the CEM framework would predict
the $x_F$ distributions for $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$ to have very similar shape, with a smaller total cross section
for $\psi'$ production.

\Cref{fig:csr_all_process} shows the extracted $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ ratios from the three processes,
Drell-Yan process, $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$ production, as measured from the SeaQuest experiment.
\begin{figure}[h!]

		as measured from the SeaQuest experiment.
	}
	\label{fig:csr_all_process}
\end{figure}
The charmonium ratios are closer to unity as compared to the Drell-Yan cross section ratio. This
is partly due to the contribution from the gluon fusion process in charmonium production. Assuming
isospin symmetry, the gluon distribution in proton and neutron should be identical, and therefore
if the production is dominated by the gluon fusion process, the charmonium ratios should be identical
to unity. The deviation from one originates from the quark-antiquark annhilation diagrams, where they
can be sensitive to the light sea-quark flavor asymmetry, like the Drell-Yan process. However, the charmonium
production proceed via the strong interaction and is insensitive to the charge of the quarks, and therefore
larger contribution from the valance quark ratio, $d(x)/u(x)$, as compared to the Drell-Yan process. Therefore,
the charmonium ratio is not as sensitive to the sea-quark asymmetry as the Drell-Yan ratio.
