\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:intro}
The SeaQuest experiment is a fixed-target experiment at Fermilab,
the primary goal of which is to investigate the antiquark structures
in the proton from the detection of $\mu^+\mu^-$ pairs produced in
the interaction of a \SI{120}{\GeV} proton beam on various targets.
The $\mu^+\mu^-$ data consist of two components, the Drell-Yan continuum
and the  $J/\Psi$ and $\Psi^\prime$ resonances.
Both the Drell-Yan and the $J/\Psi$ ($\Psi^\prime$) data can probe the antiquark structures in the proton.
The $J/\Psi$ ($\Psi^\prime$) production can further be sensitive to the gluon structure in the proton.

This thesis is organized as follows. After reviewing the early studies
on the nucleon structure and the Deep inelastic scattering in this chapter,
the Drell-Yan process and the kinematic variables are summarized in
\cref{ch:DY}. The charmonium production and gluon distribution are described
in \cref{ch:jpsi}. The SeaQuest experiment is described in \cref{M-ch:seaquest}.
\Cref{M-ch:analysis} covers the procedure for data analysis. The measured $J/\psi$
cross section and the $(p+d)/2(p+p)$ cross section ratio for bot h$J/\psi$ and Drell-Yan process
are presented in \cref{M-ch:result}, followed by a summary and future prospects
in \cref{M-ch:conclusion}.

\section{Early Evidence of the Internal Structure of Nucleon}
\pdfmargincomment{magnetic moment of proton and neutron}
The first evidence of nucleons being a composite particles comes form the
measurement of their magnetic moments. For spin 1/2 elementary particles, the
magnetic moment can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
	\mu = \frac{g}{2}\mu_B ~~~~ \mu_B = \frac{e\hbar}{2m},
\end{equation}
with $g$ expected to be \num{2}. Such measurement was first carried out in 1933.
And the $g$ factor for proton is found to be  significantly greater than \num{2}
\cite{frisch1933}. Since the neutron is a neutral particle, it was expected that
to have a zero magnetic moment. The neutron magnetic moment would later be
measured and found to be non-zero, suggesting that proton and neutron are
composite particles \cite{rabi1934a}.

The first insight into the internal structure of the nucleon came from the
electron proton elastic scattering experiments \cite{hofstadter1956} in the
1950s. The electron-proton elastic scattering cross section in the laboratory
frame can be expressed in the Rosenbluth formula \cite{rosenbluth1950}
\begin{equation}
	\dv{\sigma}{\Omega} = \frac{\alpha^2}{4E^2 \sin^2\left(\theta/2\right)}
	\frac{E^\prime}{E} \left( \frac{G_E^2+\tau G_M^2}{1+\tau} \cos^2
	\frac{\theta}{2} + 2\tau G_M^2 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\right)
	\label{eq:ep_cs},
\end{equation}
where $\tau$ is given by
\begin{equation}
	\tau = \frac{Q^2}{4m_p^2}.
\end{equation}
And $E$, $E^\prime$ are the initial and final energy of the scattered electron.
The electric ($G_E\left(Q^2\right)$) and magnetic ($G_M\left(Q^2\right)$) form
factors are functions of the negative squared of four momentum of the virtual photon. At
low-$Q^2$ limit, these form factors can be interpreted as the Fourier transforms
of the charge and magnetic moment distribution of the nucleon. \Cref{fig:charge}
shows recent extraction of the proton and neutron charge density from the electric
form factor taken from Ref.~\cite{miller2007}. In particular, it was found that
the neutron has a negatively charged center and surrounded by a positive cloud.

	\caption{The proton charge density (left panel) and neutron charge density
		(right panel). Taken from Ref.~\cite{miller2007}}.
	\label{fig:charge}
\end{figure}
These results further demonstrate the internal structure of the nucleon.

\section{Deep Inelastic Scattering}
\label{sec:dis}
Evidence of the point-like constituents in the nucleon first came from the deep
inelastic scattering (DIS) experiments \cite{breidenbach1969}, where a high
energy lepton ($l$) is inelastically scattered of a nucleon ($N$), as
illustrated in \cref{fig:DIS}
\begin{equation}
	l + N \rightarrow l^\prime + X.
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.3\linewidth]{DIS}
	\caption{The Feynman diagram for DIS}
	\label{fig:DIS}
\end{figure}
Similar to \cref{eq:ep_cs}, the DIS cross section can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
	\eval{\frac{d^2\sigma}{dE^\prime d\Omega}}_{DIS} = \frac{\alpha^2}{4E^2 \sin^4
		\frac{\theta}{2}} \left[ W_2\left(\nu,Q^2\right)\cos^2
		\frac{\theta}{2} + W_1\left(\nu,Q^2\right)\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}
		\right],
	\label{eq:DIS_cs1}
\end{equation}
where $\nu$ is the energy transferred by the scattering lepton. It is also
customary to the define the structure functions $F_{1,2}$ from $W_{1,2}$ as:
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		F_1\left(x,Q^2\right) &= MW_1\left(\nu,Q^2\right),\\
		F_2\left(x,Q^2\right) &= \nu W_2\left(\nu,Q^2\right),
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $x=Q^2/2M\nu$ and $M$ is the mass of the nucleon. It was observed that at sufficiently high $Q^2$,
these structure functions $F_{1,2}$ are independent of $Q^2$, as illustrated in
\cref{fig:w2}. \Cref{fig:w2} shows the early measurements of the
structure function $F_2=\nu W_2$ as a function of $Q^2$ for a fixed
$x=1/\omega=0.25$ taken from Ref.~\cite{friedman1972}. This observation is
known as Bjorken scaling \cite{bjorken1969}.
\begin{figure}[htpb!]

		that $F_2(x,Q^2)$ is independent of $Q^2$ is known as Bjorken scaling. }
	\label{fig:w2}
\end{figure}

\section{Parton Model}
\label{sec:parton}
To explain the scaling behavior, Feynman proposed the parton model \cite{feynman1969}.
In this model, hadrons are treated as extended objects which are made up of
constituents (partons) held together by their mutual interaction. We now know
these partons are quarks and gluons described by QCD, but this was not known at
the time. Consider the DIS process, the hadron is Lorentz contracted in the
direction of the collision in the center-of-mass frame, and the internal
interaction are time dilated. Hence as the center-of-mass energy increases, the
lifetime of the virtual partonic state is lengthened, and the time for the
electron to pass trough the hadron is shortened. If the lifetime of the virtual
partonic states is longer than the duration of the electron-hadron interaction,
the partons are essentially frozen and the parton-parton interactions are
neglectable. The hadrons can be considered as a collection of ``free'' partons,
and each parton may be thought of as carrying a definite fraction $x$ of the
hadron's momentum. The high energy lepton in DIS can be treated as scattering
off these partons elastically. The electron-parton elastic scattering can be
calculated using perturbative QCD, whereas the non-perturbative long-range
interaction within the hadron is encapsulated in the Parton Distribution
Function (PDF) $f_{a/h}\left(x\right)$, which can be interpreted as the probability
of finding a parton of species $a$ in hadron $h$ with fraction $x$ of the hadron's momentum.
And the structure functions and the cross section can be written as a convolution
of the non-perturbative PDF and the perturbative short range interaction. To Leading
order, the structure function $F_2\left(x,Q^2\right)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
	F_2\left(x,Q^2\right)=x\sum_i e^2_i f_i\left(x,Q^2\right),
	\label{eq:F2_parton}
\end{equation}
where $e_i$ is the charge carried quark and antiquark of flavors $i$. Since, the
gluon does not carry any charge, it does not enter the cross section at leading
order. The ability to write the structure function and the cross section as a
convolution of the non-perturbative PDF and pertubative short range interaction
is known as the factorization theorem \cite{collins1989}. These PDFs are also
expected to be universal and independent of the details of the scattering
process, as they describe the dynamics of the partons in a given hadron.

In the parton model, the structure functions $F_{1,2}$ are clearly related. And
from \cref{eq:DIS_cs1}, the structure function $F_1$ is
related to the magnetic form factor $G_M$ in \cref{eq:ep_cs}. If the partons
are spin 0 particles, one would expect $F_1$ to be zero. In leading order of QCD,
only the quarks and antiquarks contribute to the cross section. Since quarks and
antiquarks are spin 1/2 particles, this relation is given by the Callan-Gross
relation \cite{callan1968,callan1969}
\begin{equation}
	F_2\left(x\right) = 2x F_1\left(x\right).
\end{equation}
The measured deviation of the Callan-Gross relation, defined as
\begin{equation}
	K_0 = \frac{F_2}{2xF_1}-1,
\end{equation}
is shown in \cref{fig:callan_gross}, taken from Ref.~\cite{kendall1991}.
For large $Q^2$, $K_0$ is consistent with zero, establishing the spin of the
charged partons is 1/2.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Callan_Gross_relation}
	\caption{The deviation from the Callan-Gross relation, defined as
		$K_0=F_2/2xF_1 -1$, taken from Ref.~\cite{kendall1991}. This result
		demonstrates the spin 1/2 nature of the partons.}
	\label{fig:callan_gross}
\end{figure}

\section{Sum Rules}
\label{sec:sum_rules}
Since hadrons are characterized by their quantum numbers, and these quantum numbers
are carried by the constituent partons, these quantum numbers serve as constrains
on these PDFs. For example, using the numbers of valance quarks in the protons,
one can impose the following constrains
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\int_{0}^{1} \dd{x} \left[f_{u/p} \left(x\right)-f_{\bar{u}/p} \left(x\right)\right]&=2,\\
		\int_{0}^{1} \dd{x} \left[f_{d/p} \left(x\right)-f_{\bar{d}/p} \left(x\right)\right]&=1,\\
		\int_{0}^{1} \dd{x} \left[f_{i/p} \left(x\right)-f_{\bar{i}/p} \left(x\right)\right]&=0 \qquad \text{for other quark flavors}.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
And the momentum of the hadron should be distributed among the partons, hence
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i=q,\bar{q},g}\int_{0}^{1} \dd{x} xf_{i/h}\left(x\right)=1.
\end{equation}
An important sum rule is the Gottfired sum rule \cite{gottfried1967}. It can be obtained
if we use the isospin symmetry to relate the neutron distributions to those of
the proton, namely the (anti) up quark in the neutron would have the same distribution
as (anti) down quark in proton, and vice-versa; the other quarks flavors and gluon
distribution would be the same in both proton and neutron.
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\bar{u}(x) &\equiv f_{\bar{u}/p}(x) = f_{\bar{d}/n}(x),\text{ and }\\
		\bar{d}(x) &\equiv f_{\bar{d}/p}(x) = f_{\bar{u}/n}(x).
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
Using this relation
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		S_G & = \int_0^1 \frac{\dd{x}}{x}\left(F_2^{p} - F_{2}^{n}\right)\\
		& = \frac{1}{3} \int_0^1 \dd{x} \left[u\left(x\right) - d\left(x\right)
			+ \bar{u}\left(x\right) - \bar{d}\left(x\right)\right]\\
		& = \frac{1}{3} \int_0^1 \dd{x} \left[u\left(x\right) - \bar{u}\left(x\right)\right]
		- \frac{1}{3} \int_0^1 \dd{x} \left[d\left(x\right) - \bar{d}\left(x\right)\right]
		+ \frac{2}{3} \int_0^1 \dd{x} \left[\bar{u}\left(x\right)-\bar{d}\left(x\right)\right]\\
		& = \frac{1}{3} + \frac{2}{3} \int_0^1 \dd{x} \left[\bar{u}\left(x\right)-\bar{d}\left(x\right)\right].
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
If one made the naive assumption that $\bar{u}\left(x\right)= \bar{d}\left(x\right)$,
then $S_G$ would be expected to be $1/3$. And this assumption can be tested using DIS.
One of the early measurements is from the New Muon Collaboration (NMC) \cite{amaudruz1991}.
The measured $F_2^p-F_2^n$ by NMC is shown in \cref{fig:NMC_Gottfried}.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{Gottfried}
	\caption{The difference $F_2^p -F_2^n$ (solid and scale to the right) and
		$\int_{x_{min}}^1 (F_2^p-F_2^n)\dd{x}/x$ (open and scale to the left)
		determined by NMC, taken from Ref.~\cite{amaudruz1991}. The extrpolation
		to $x_{min}=0$ is indicated by the bar.}
	\label{fig:NMC_Gottfried}
\end{figure}
The measured Gottfried sum is $0.240 \pm 0.016$, which is significantly below
$1/3$, suggesting an asymmetry in the light sea-quarks.

\section{Quantum Chromodynamics}
\label{sec:QCD}
\pdfmargincomment{General QCD}
Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is a theory of the strong interactions. It was
introduced by Fritzsch and Gell-Mann \cite{fritzsch1972} and Fritzsch, Gell-Mann,
and Leutwyler \cite{fritzsch1973}. QCD is a non-abelian gauge theory with an
$SU(3)$ gauge symmetry applied to he color degree of freedom. The $SU(3)$ group
chosen be to account for (a) meson states made up of $q\bar{q}$ but not $qq$ bound states.
(b) There must color singlet states. (c) The number of colors for each flavor of
must be in agreement with the measured hadronic $e^+ e^-$ cross-section.


An important feature of QCD is the asymptotic freedom. Being a renormalizable
theory, a regularization procedure and a set of renormalization prescription
need to be specified. In the renormalization process, the renomalized coupling $\alpha$
is introduced and this coupling would be a function of the renomalization scale $\mu$.
It is noted that the coupling constant vanishes as $Q/\mu$ tends to infinity.
Allowing perturbative expansion of QCD at large $Q$.


\subsection{QCD Improved Parton Model and Scaling Violation}
\label{subsec:scaling_violation}
In QCD, the parton distribution functions can be defined as matrix elements of
operators acting on the hadron state. These operators act to count the number of
quarks and gluon carrying a fraction $\xi$ of the hadron's momentum. For quarks,
the distribution is given by \cite{collins1989}
\begin{equation}
	f_{q/h}\left(\xi\right) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\int \dd{x} e^{-i\xi P^{+} x^{-}} \mel{P}{\bar{\psi}\left(0,x^-,0_\perp\right)\gamma^+ \mathcal{G} \psi\left(0,0,0_\perp\right)}{P},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{G}$ is the gauge link operator
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{G}=\mathcal{P} \exp \left\{ ig\int_0^{x^-}\dd{y^-} A_c^+ \left(0,y^-,0_\perp\right)t_c\right\},
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{P}$ denoted the path ordering of the gluon field operators $A_a^+$
along the path. Similarly, the gluon distribution function is given by
\begin{equation}
	f_{g/h}\left(\xi\right) = \frac{1}{2\pi\xi P^+}\int \dd{x} e^{-i\xi P^{+} x^{-}} \mel{P}{\tensor{F_a\left(0,x^-,0_\perp\right)}{^+^\nu}\gamma^{+} \tensor{\mathcal{G}}{_a_b} \tensor{F_b\left(0,0,0_\perp\right)}{_\nu^+}}{P},
\end{equation}
where $F^a_{\mu\nu}$ is the field operator and the octet representation of the $SU(3)$
generating matrices $t_c$ is used in $\mathcal{G}$.

\pdfmargincomment{QCD correction to parton model: Q2 dependence introduce by the
	renormalization and factorization}

The QCD generalization of \cref{eq:F2_parton} is given
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{x}F_2\left(x,Q^2\right) = \sum_a \int_x^1 \frac{\dd{\xi}}{x}f_{a/h}\left(\xi,\mu\right)\frac{\xi}{x}H_{2a}\left( \frac{x}{\xi}, \frac{Q}{\mu}, \alpha_s\left(\mu\right)\right)
	+ \text{Remainder}
\end{equation}
The hard scattering coefficient $H_{2a}$ would be power series in $\alpha_s$. It
can be shown the remainder is suppress by powers of $Q$. Here the parton
distribution also depends on the renormalization scale $\mu$. This scale
dependency is introduce by the renomalization procedure. By requiring the cross
section and the structure functions to be independent of the scale $\mu$,
one can show that the renormalization group equation for the distribution
functions is
\begin{equation}
	\mu\frac{d}{d\mu}f_{a/h}\left(\xi,\mu\right)=\sum_b \int_\xi^1 \frac{\dd{\zeta}}{\zeta} P_{a/b}\left(\zeta,\alpha_s\left(\mu\right)\right) f_{b/h}\left(\frac{\xi}{\zeta},\mu\right),
\end{equation}
where $P_{a/b}$ is the Altarelli-Parisi kernel \cite{altarelli1977}.

At order $\alpha_s$, the $F_2$ structure function is given by \cite{collins1989}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{x} F_2\left(x,Q^2\right) = \sum_j e^2_j f_{j/h}\left(x,\mu\right) + \sum_{j,b} e^2_j \int^1_x \frac{\dd{\xi}}{\xi} f_{b/h}\left(x,\mu\right) \frac{\alpha_s}{\pi} C_{jb}\left(\frac{x}{\xi}, \frac{Q}{\mu}\right) + \mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2).
\end{equation}
The sums over $j$ runs over the quarks and antiquarks flavors. While the gluons
did not contribute at leading order, they contribute at order $\alpha_s$ through
virtual quark-antiquark pairs. The hard scattering coefficients $C_{jb}$ are
given by
\begin{align}
	C_{jk}(z,1) & = \delta_{jk} \frac{4}{3} \left[ -\frac{1}{2}\frac{1+z^2}{1-z} \ln\left(\frac{z}{1-z}\right) + \frac{3}{4} \frac{1}{1-z} -\frac{3}{2} -z\right]_+ \\
	C_{jg}(z,1) & = -\frac{1}{2} \left\{ \frac{1}{2}\left[z^2+(1-z)^2\right] \left[\ln\left(\frac{z}{1-z}\right)+1\right] -3z(1-z)\right\},
\end{align}
where the plus sign denote the subtraction that regulate the $z\rightarrow1$
singularity,
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\int^1_x \dd{z} \left[C(z)\right]_+ h(z) &= \int_0^1 \dd{z} \left[C(z)\right]_+ h(z)\Theta(z>x)\\
		& = \int_0^1 \dd{z} C(z) \left\{h(z)\Theta(z>x) -h(1)\right\}.
	\end{split}
\end{equation}

It is customary to choose $\mu =Q$ to avoid large logarithms of $\mu /Q$ in the
power expansions of $H$. As such the $\mu$ dependency in the parton distribution
functions can be interpreted as a virtual photon with higher $Q$ would probe the
nucleon with better resolution.

\Cref{fig:CT18_scale} shows the PDF extracted by CTEQ-TEA collaboration in their
CT18 global analysis \cite{hou2019}. At larger $Q$, the sea-quarks and gluon
carry at larger portion of the proton's momentum.

\end{figure}


\chapter{Drell-Yan Process}
\label{ch:DY}
Another process for probing the hadron structure is the Drell-Yan process \cite{drell1970}.
As illustrated in \cref{fig:DY}, this process involves two partons from the
two colliding hadrons to annihilate and form a lepton pair.
\begin{equation}
	h_A + h_B \rightarrow l + \bar{l} + X.
\end{equation}
The Drell-Yan process is related to the DIS process via crossing symmetry.
\begin{figure}[htbp!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{Drell-Yan}
	\caption{The leading order Feynman diagram for the Drell-Yan process}
	\label{fig:DY}
\end{figure}
Similar to DIS, the Drell-Yan cross section can be factorized into the non-perturbative
PDF and the purtabative parton-parton scattering. And the proof of factorization
theorem for Drell-Yan can be found in Ref.~\cite{collins1989}. At leading-order,
the cross section can be written as
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d^2\sigma_{DY}}{dx_{1}dx_{2}} = \frac{4\pi\alpha^2}{9M^2}\sum_i e^2_i
	\left[f_{i/A}\left(x_1\right)f_{\bar{i}/B}\left(x_2\right) +
	f_{\bar{i}/A}\left(x_1\right)f_{i/B}\left(x_2\right)
	\right],
	\label{eq:DY_cs}
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the mass of the lepton pair, $x_1$ and $x_2$ are the momentum fraction
of carried by the partons from the two colliding hadrons. They are related through the following 
\begin{equation}
	M^2= sx_1x_2
	\label{eq:mass}
\end{equation}
Since the underlying mechanism for the Drell-Yan process at leading order involves the annihilation
of a quark and antiquark, this process is particularly useful in probing the antiquark
content of the hadron.

\end{figure}
At NLO ($\mathcal{O}\left(\alpha_s\right)$), diagram such as gluon breamstrahlung
and Compton scattering begin to contribute, as shown in \cref{fig:NLO_DY}.
And the NLO expression can be written as a sum of the contribution from $q\bar{q}$
annihilation process 
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d^2\sigma_A}{dQ^2dx_{F}} = \frac{4\pi\alpha^2}{9M^2} \sum_i e^2_i \int^1_{x_1} \dd{t_1} \int^1_{x_2} \dd{t_2}
	\left[ \frac{\hat{\sigma_{DY}}}{dQ^2dx_F}+\frac{\hat{\sigma_{A}}}{dQ^2dx_F} \right] 
	\left[f_{i/A}\left(x_1\right)f_{\bar{i}/B}\left(x_2\right) +
	f_{\bar{i}/A}\left(x_1\right)f_{i/B}\left(x_2\right)
	\right]
\end{equation}
and Compton scattering process
\begin{equation}
	\frac{d^2\sigma_A}{dQ^2dx_{F}} = \frac{4\pi\alpha^2}{9M^2} \sum_i e^2_i \int^1_{x_1} \dd{t_1} \int^1_{x_2} \dd{t_2}
	\frac{\hat{\sigma_{C}}}{dQ^2dx_F} f_{g/A}\left(x_1\right)
	\left[f_{i/B}\left(x_2\right) +f_{\bar{i}/B}\left(x_2\right)
	+ 1 \leftrightarrow 2 \right],
\end{equation}
where the leading order Drell-Yan term is 
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\hat{\sigma_{DY}}}{dQ^2dx_F} = \frac{1}{x_1 x_2} \delta(t_1 - x_1)\delta(t_2 - x_2)
\end{equation}
and $\frac{\hat{\sigma_{A}}}{dQ^2dx_F}$ and $\frac{\hat{\sigma_{C}}}{dQ^2dx_F}$
are the contribution from $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s)$ annihilation and Compton scattering process respectively.
The exact expression can be found in Ref.~\cite{sutton1992}.

\Cref{fig:scaling} shows some of the existing data on DIS and Drell-Yan compared with NLO calculation. By
performing a global fit to both DIS and Drell-Yan data, the parton distribution
functions can be extracted. The ability to fit both DIS and Drell-Yan data using
the same PDF demonstrate the universality of the PDF and the usefulness of the
factorization theorem.

	\label{fig:scaling}
\end{figure}
One of the advantages of Drell-Yan over DIS is the explicit separation of the quark
and anti-quark distributions in \cref{eq:DY_cs}. At large $x$, DIS cross section
is dominated by the valance quark distribution. On the other hand, in the region $x_1 \gg x_2$,
the valance quark in the Drell-Yan process is more likely to come from the beam
hadron, and the anti-quark is more likely to come from the target hadron. Hence,
Drell-Yan can be more sensitive to the anti-quark distribution than DIS. In
particular, for high $x_F$ and using the fact there are two up valance quarks in
protons, the $(p+d/2(p+p))$ Drell-Yan cross section ratio at leading order 
can be approximated as
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\sigma^{p+d}}{2\sigma^{p+p}} \approx \frac{1}{2} \left( 1+ \frac{\bar{d}\left(x_2\right)}{\bar{u}\left(x_2\right)} \right).
\end{equation}
Thus the Drell-Yan process has been used in many experiments to probe the sea-quarks
asymmetry.


\section{E866/NuSea}
\label{sec:E866}
The E866/NuSea experiment \cite{towell2001} was designed to measure the flavor structure of the sea
quark over a broad range of $x$ to higher precision than previous experiments. The
experiment utilized the \SI{800}{\GeV} proton beam from the Tevatron on liquid
hydrogen and deuterium targets. The measured deuteriuym over hydrogen cross section
ratio from E866/NuSea is shown in \cref{fig:e866_result}. They observed the
cross section ratio drop off below unity at $x_2>0.25$, suggesting the $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$
ratio drop off below 1. Various models had difficulties explaining this surprising
behavior. Due to the large uncertainty on the data points at large $x_2$, a new
experiment was needed to explore sea quark asymmetry the high $x$ region with better
accuracy.

\section{Origin of the \texorpdfstring{$\bar{d}/\bar{u}$}{dbar/ubar} Asymmetry }
After the result from NMC and other DIS experiments indicating the violation of the Gottfired sum rule,
various models have been proposed to explain the $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ asymmetry. One of the early proposal
is by Field and Feynman \cite{field1977}. They suggested that the Pauli blocking effect
could suppress the production of $u\bar{u}$ pairs relative to  $d\bar{d}$ as due to the presence of two
valance $u$ quarks in the proton. It was later shown that the effect by Pauli blocking would be small and
may actually have an opposite effect \cite{steffens1997}. Since the contribution from gluon splitting to the
sea quarks is flavor-blind and the mass of $u$ and $d$ quarks are roughly equal, the asymmetry in the
light sea-quarks must originate from a non-perturbative mechanism. Some of the models will be presented
in this section.

\subsection{Meson Cloud Model}
Some of the early models attribute the asymmetry to the existence of a ``pion cloud'' in the proton.
In the meson cloud model \cite{kumano1998} the proton wave function is written as a sum of meson-baryon state
\begin{equation}
	\ket{p} = \sqrt{Z}\ket{p_0} + \sum_{MB}\int \dd{y} \dd[2]{\vec{k}_\perp} \phi_{BM} \left(y, \vec{k}_\perp\right)\ket{B\left(y, \vec{k}_\perp\right);MB\left(1-y, -\vec{k}_\perp\right)}
\end{equation}
where $\phi_{BM}$ is the probability amplitude to find a physical nucleon in a state consisting of a virtual
meson $M$ and virtual baryon $B$ with longitudinal momentum fraction $y$ and $1-y$ and transverse momenta
$\vec{k}_\perp$ and $-\vec{k}_\perp$.

The main hypothesis is that the hard photon in the DIS process interact with the virtual meson or the virtual
baryon. Therefore, the PDF can be related to the PDF of either the stuck meson or stuck baryon.
\begin{equation}
	f_{i/N}\left(x\right) = f_{i/N}^{\mathrm{bare}}\left(x\right) +  \int^1_x f_{MB/N}\left(y\right) f_{i/M}\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) \frac{\dd{y}}{y} + \int^1_x f_{BM/N}\left(y\right) f_{i/B}\left(\frac{x}{y}\right) \frac{\dd{y}}{y},
\end{equation}
where $f_{MB/N}$ and $f_{BM/N}$ are the splitting function, related to $\phi_{BM}$.
If we restrict to $\pi N$ and $\pi\Delta$ states, and using isospin symmetry,
\begin{align}
	f_{\pi^+n/p}=\frac{2}{3} f_{\pi N}                                       & , ~f_{\pi^0 p/p}=\frac{1}{3} f_{\pi N}                                         \\
	f_{\pi^-\Delta^{++}/p}=\frac{1}{2} f_{\pi \Delta}, ~f_{\pi^0 \Delta^+/p} & =\frac{1}{3} f_{\pi \Delta},  ~f_{\pi^+ \Delta^0/p}=\frac{1}{6} f_{\pi \Delta}
\end{align}
Therefore the light sea-quark distribution in the proton is given by
\begin{align}
	\bar{d}(x) & = \left(\frac{5}{6}f_{\pi N} + \frac{1}{3}f_{\pi \Delta}\right)\otimes q^v_\pi + S(x) \\
	\bar{u}(x) & = \left(\frac{1}{6}f_{\pi N} + \frac{2}{3}f_{\pi \Delta}\right)\otimes q^v_\pi + S(x)
\end{align}
where $f\otimes q\equiv \int^1_x \frac{dy}{y}f(y)q\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)$, and $q^v_\pi$ is the valance
quark distribution in pions and $S(x)$ is the flavor symmetric contributions.
The asymmetry in the proton sea arises because of the dominance of the $\pi^+$ among the $\pi N$ states.
However, the effect is slightly canceled out by the $\pi\Delta$ configurations. \Cref{fig:pion_cloud}
shows the predicted $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ from the meson cloud model, taken from Ref.~\cite{alberg2022}.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{rediff}
	\caption{The predicted $\bar{d}-\bar{u}$ from the meson cloud model and compared with the E866 results (blue symbol). Taken from Ref.~\cite{alberg2022}}
	\label{fig:pion_cloud}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Chiral Quark Model}
Similar to the meson cloud model, the chiral quark model \cite{li1998} attribute the sea quarks to
the present of Goldstone boson in the nucleon. However, the Goldstone boson in chiral quark model
is emitted from the the valance quarks.
\begin{equation}
	q_{\pm} \rightarrow GB + q^\prime_\mp \rightarrow \left(q q^\prime\right)_0 q_{\mp}^\prime.
\end{equation}
For example, after one emission, the $u$ quark wavefuction would have the following components
\begin{equation}
	\Psi\left(u\right) \sim \left[d\pi^+ + s K^+ + u \left(\frac{\pi^0}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{\eta}{\sqrt{6}}\right)\right],
\end{equation}
which can be expressed in terms of the quark contents by using $\pi^+ = u\bar{d}$ and $K^+ = u\bar{s}$. etc.
The probability of the transitions is given by the squaring the wavefunction, and if
\begin{equation}
	Prob\left[ u_+ \rightarrow \pi^+d_-\right] \equiv a,
\end{equation}
and using isospin asymmetry to determine the $d$ quark wavefucntion, the number of antiquark after one emission
by the initial $(2u+d)$ valance quarks in the proton is given by
\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\bar{u} & = 2\cross\frac{4}{9}a +a+\frac{1}{9}a = 2a,                         \\
		\bar{d} & = 2\cross\left(a+\frac{1}{9}a\right) + \frac{4}{9}a = \frac{8}{3}a.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Therefore the model predicts a light sea-quark asymmetry $\bar{d}/\bar{u} =\frac{4}{3} $.

\subsection{Statistical Model}
In the statistical model\cite{bourrely2015}, the nucleon is viewed as a gas of massless partons in equilibrium in
a finite volume. And the parton distributions at the initial scale would then be proportional to
\begin{equation}
	\left[ \exp\left[\left(x-X_{0p}\right)/\bar{x}\right] \pm 1 \right]^{-1},
\end{equation}
where the plus sign for the quarks and antiquarks corresponds to a Fermi-Dirac distribution and
the minus sign for gluons corresponds to a Bose-Einstein distribution. The constant $X_{0p}$
plays the role of the thermodynamic potential of the parton $p$ and $\bar{x}$ is the universal
temperature.

In this model, the potential of a quark $q_i^h$ with helicity $h$ is opposite to the potential
of the corresponding antiquark $q_i^{-h}$ with helicity $-h$
\begin{equation}
	X_{0q}^h = -X_{0\bar{q}}^{-h}.
	\label{eq:stat_potential}
\end{equation}
Since there are more $u$ quarks than $d$ quarks in the proton, one would expect
\begin{equation}
	X_{0u}^+ + X_{0u}^- > X_{0d}^+ + X_{0d}^-,
\end{equation}
and combing with \cref{eq:stat_potential}, one would expect $\bar{d} > \bar{u}$ in the proton.

\subsection{Five-quark Intrinsic Sea Model}
In the 1980s, Brodsky, Hoyer, Peterson and Sakai (BHPS) \cite{brodsky1980}, proposed
the possible existance of a significant $\ket{uudc\bar{c}}$ five-quark Fock state component
in the proton in order to explain the larger than expected charmed hadrons production rate.

\pdfcomment{need more description on intrinsic sea and how is it difference from extrinsic}

Since the BHPS model also predicts the probability for the $\ket{uudQ\bar{Q}}$ configuration to
be inversely proportional to the mass of the quark $Q$, the intrinsic sea can have important
contribution to the light sea-quarks. In Ref.~\cite{chang2011,chang2011a}, the BHPS model
was extend to the light quark sector and is compared with experimental measurements.
Recent global analysis from NNPDF \cite{ball2022} and measurement from the LHCb \cite{aaij2022}
has shown the importance of intrinsic charm in the proton.



\subsection{Lattice QCD}
Lattice QCD calculations of the $\bar{d} - \bar{u}$ based on the Large Momentum Effective
theory (LaMET) \cite{ji2021,constantinou2021} have become available recently by two different groups ,LP3\cite{chen2018} and ETMC\cite{alexandrou2018}.
The parton distribution functions described quarks and gluons in hadrons traveling at infinite
momentum. The principle for LaMET comes from the observation that the structure of the proton is
approximately independent of its momentum so long as it is much larger than the strong interaction
scale or its mass. Therefore the patronic structure can be calculated for a proton with
moderately-large momentum and taking the limit of the proton momentum to infinity.

	\label{fig:lamet}
\end{figure}
\Cref{fig:lamet} shows the result using LaMET from two different groups and are compared with
different global PDF extractions. While the result by the LP3 collaboration
is in good agreement with CT14, the result from the ETMC group differs from the PDFs,
especially in the antiquark region. 




\chapter{Charmonium Production}
\label{ch:jpsi}
Yet another process for probing the nucleon structure is via the charmonium production \cite{peng1995,chang2020}.
Unlike DIS and Drell-Yan, the charmonium production involves the strong interaction
at leading-order. Therefore it can be used to probe the gluon structure, which is
less sensitive in DIS or Drell-Yan, and the quark anti-quark structure. However,
because of the non-pertiubative nature of QCD, there are various models for
calculating the charmonium production. The models usually separate the production
mechanism into two parts, the production of heavy-quark pairs and the subsequent
hadronization into quarkonium states. One of the early approaches is the Color
Evaporation method (CEM) \cite{einhorn1975,bodwin1995,bodwin1997}. The heavy-quark
pairs production is expanded in terms of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$
and is calculated with perturbative QCD (pQCD). CEM then assumes a constant
probability $F$ for the $c\bar{c}$ pairs to hadronize into different charmonium
state and this probability is independent of the kinematics or the production
subprocess. The charmonium production cross section in the CEM framework can be
expressed as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\left.\frac{d\sigma}{dx_F}\right|_{J/\Psi} &= F \sum_{i,j = q,\bar{q},G}\int^{2m_D}_{2m_c} dM_{c\bar{c}}  \frac{2M_{c\bar{c}}}{s\sqrt{x_F^2+4M_{c\bar{c}}^2/s}}\\
		&\cross f_{i/A}\left(x_1,\mu_F\right)f_{j/B}\left(x_2,\mu_F\right)\sigma\left[ij\rightarrow c\bar{c}X\right]\left(x_1P_A,x_2P_B,\mu_F,\mu_R \right),
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $i$,$j$ denote the type of interacting partons. At leading-order, the
$c\bar{c}$ pairs are produced via two subprocesses, gluon fusion and
quark-antiquark annihilation, as illustrated in \cref{fig:charmonium}.
\begin{figure}[htpb!]

\end{figure}
The calculated cross section for $J/\Psi$ production in $p+p$ at 120 GeV using
CEM is shown in \cref{fig:cem_cs}. The relative importance of gluon fusion
and quark-antiquark annihilation is a strong function of $x_F=2P_L/\sqrt{s}$,
where $P_L$ is the longitudinal momentum of the $J/\Psi$ meson in the
hadron-hadron center-of-mass frame and $\sqrt{s}$ is the total energy in this
frame. At large $x_F$, the quark-antiquark annihilation is the dominant subprocess.

	\caption{Calculated cross section for $J/\Psi$ production using CEM model.
		The CEM code is obtained from Ref.~\cite{mangano1993}.}
	\label{fig:cem_cs}
\end{figure}

Another theoretical model for quarkonium productions is the non-relativistic
QCD (NRQCD) \cite{bodwin1995,bodwin1997}. Unlike CEM, the probability of
hadronization depends on the color and spin state of the $c\bar{c}$ pairs and
is described by various long-distance matrix elements (LDMEs). The quarkonium
production cross section in this framework is given as
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		\frac{d\sigma^H}{dx_F} &=\sum_{i,j = q,\bar{q},G}\int^1_0 dx_1 dx_2 \delta(x_F-x_1+x_2)\\
		&\cross f_{i/A}\left(x_1,\mu_F\right)f_{j/B}\left(x_2,\mu_F\right)\hat{\sigma}\left[ij\rightarrow H\right]\left(x_1P_A,x_2P_B,\mu_F,\mu_R , m_c\right),
	\end{split}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\hat{\sigma}\left[ij\rightarrow H\right]= \sum_n C^{ij}_{c\bar{c}\left[n\right]}\left(x_1P_A,x_2P_B,\mu_F,\mu_R , m_c\right)\expval{O^H_n \left[^{2S+1}L_J\right]},
\end{equation}
where the $c\bar{c}$ pair is labeled by its color ($n$), spin ($S$), orbital
angular momentum ($L$) and total angular momentum ($J$). The coefficient
$C^{ij}_{c\bar{c}\left[n\right]}$ describes the production of $c\bar{c}$ pair
with specific color-spin state and is calculated perturbatively in powers of
$\alpha_s$ using pQCD. The LDME $\expval{O^H_n \left[^{2S+1}L_J\right]}$ accounts
for the hardronization probability for a specfic $c\bar{c}$ state into the
charmonium state $H$. These LDMEs are obtained by fitting to data and assumed to
be universal, independent of beam or target hadrons and the energy scale. The
calculated cross sections for $J/\Psi$ and $\Psi'$ production using NRQCD for
$p+p$ at 120 GeV are shown in \cref{fig:NRQCD_cs}. In this model, quark-antiquark
annihilation is more important than suggested by CEM. This model also suggests
that the relative importance of the two subprocess depends on the charmonium state.
In particular, \cref{fig:NRQCD_cs} shows that the quark-antiquark annihilation
is the dominant process for $\Psi^\prime$ production.
