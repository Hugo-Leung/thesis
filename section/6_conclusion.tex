SpinQuest is expected to run until summer 2024\pdfcomment{check date}. The Sivers
asymtry in both Drell-Yan and charmonium production can be extracted from the full
data set once it is made available.
\pdfmargincomment{full datasets from spinquest}

There is also interest in using the SpinQuest Spectormeter for dark photon search
\cite{apyan2022}. A electromagnetic calorimeter would be place behind tht Station 3 chambers and 
in front of the absorber for electrons identification.
