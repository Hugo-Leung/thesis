\section{Charmonium Cross Section}

\subsection{Massfit results}
The massfits in all $x_F$ bins are shown in \cref{fig:massfit_57-70_xF,fig:massfit_5-6_xF},
and the fits in the $P_T$ bins are shown in \cref{fig:massfit_57-70_pT,fig:massfit_5-6_pT}.
The two datasets are analyzed separately. The data in each bin is very well described by the fitting procedure
and the $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$ yields can be extracted from the fits directly.

With the yields extracted, the cross section can be calculated.

The results from the two datasets are combined by taking the average, weighted by
the inverse of the total uncertainties squared.
The results from combined analysis are shown in \cref{fig:cs_xF_full} and are tabulated in

While the extracted $J/\psi$ cross section is in very good agreement with the NRQCD calculation,
the extracted $\psi'$
cross section disagree with the prediction, particular at large $x_F$. At large $x_F$ the NRQCD
calculation suggests the $\psi'$ should be dominated by the $q\bar{q}$ annihilation.
It is possible that the LDMEs used  for the $\psi'$ cross section calculation are not fully optimized,
and the $q\bar{q}$ annihilation is more important than suggested. This new result on the $\psi'$
cross section can be used in further constrain the LDMEs.

The ratios of $\sigma_{\psi'}/\sigma_{J/\psi}$ as a function of $x_F$ are also shown in \cref{fig:cs_xF_full}.
This ratio shows a clear $x_F$ dependence and increases at large $x_F$. In the NRQCD framework,
the difference in the $x_F$ distributions between $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$ is mostly originated
from the relative weighting between the different production subprocess.
In the CEM framework, the hadronization probability only depends on
the final charmonium state, but not the underlying subprocess. Therefore, the CEM framework would predict
the $x_F$ distributions for $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$ to have very similar shape, with a smaller total cross section
for $\psi'$ production.

\Cref{fig:csr_all_process} shows the extracted $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ ratios from the three processes,
Drell-Yan process, $J/\psi$ and $\psi'$ production, as measured from the SeaQuest experiment.

	\label{fig:csr_all_process}
\end{figure}
The charmonium ratios are closer to unity as compared to the Drell-Yan cross section ratio. This
is partly due to the contribution from the gluon fusion process in charmonium production. Assuming
charge symmetry, the gluon distribution in proton and neutron should be identical, and therefore
if the production is dominated by the gluon fusion process, the charmonium ratios should be identical
to unity. The deviation from one originates from the quark-antiquark annhilation diagrams, where they
can be sensitive to the light sea-quark flavor asymmetry, like the Drell-Yan process. However, the charmonium
production proceed via the strong interaction and is insensitive to the charge of the quarks, and therefore
larger contribution from the valance quark ratio, $d(x)/u(x)$, as compared to the Drell-Yan process. Therefore,
the charmonium ratio is not as sensitive to the sea-quark asymmetry as the Drell-Yan ratio.

\Cref{fig:pT_s} shows the extracted $\expval{P_T^2}$ for $p+p\to J/\psi$ as a function
of $\sqrt{s}$ from SeaQuest compared with different experiments
\cite{badier1983,clark1978,drapier1998,acharya2020}. The $\expval{P_T^2}$ follows an
increasing pattern versus $\sqrt{s}$ over a wide range of energies.
A linear fit versus the log of the center of mass energy~\cite{acharya2020},
\begin{equation}
	\expval{P_T^2}=a\ln{\left( \frac{\sqrt{s}}{b} \right)},
\end{equation}
describe the general trend, but some variation is expected due to the differing
rapidity range of the measurements.
The fitted parameters are $a=1.173\pm0.041$ and $b=7.17\pm0.35$.
