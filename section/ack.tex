	This thesis is a product of collaboration with a large number of talented
	individuals with whom I have had the privilege of working with over the past
	few years.

	First and foremost I would like to thank my advisor, Prof. Jen-Chieh Peng, for
	his continuous support and assistance. I would also like to express my
	appreciation for his efforts, guidance and encouragement through out this whole
	journey.

	I would also like to thank former graduate students Jason Dove and Shivangi
	Prasad with helping me learn the ropes. Discussions with both Jason and
	Shivangi have been very helpful in organize my thoughts.

	I would like to thank both the SeaQuest and SpinQuest collaborations.
	This study would not be possible with out the tremendous work by all the
	collaborators. Particularly, I would also like to thank Kiu Liu of Los Almos
	National Lab and Rick Tesarek of Fermilab for their help and guidance during my
	stay in Fermilab.

	Last and certainly not least, I would like to extend my gratitude to my family 
	for support in my 	pursuit of a Ph.D half way across the glob, particularly 
	during the pandemic.

	This research is supported by National Science Foundation via grant No.XXXXXXX.
