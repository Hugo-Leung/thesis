\begin{acknowledgments}
	This thesis is a product of collaboration with a large number of talented
	individuals with whom I have had the privilege of working with over the past
	few years. I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of them for all
	their support, without which it would not be possible to finish this work.

	First and foremost I would like to thank my advisor, Prof.~Jen-Chieh Peng, for
	his continuous support and assistance. His constant encouragement and feedback
	have be extremely important at every step in this research. 
	I would also like to express my	appreciation for his efforts and guidance 
	through out this whole journey, which helped me learn and develop a broad
	understanding of the field.

	I would also like to thank former graduate students Jason Dove and Shivangi
	Prasad with helping me learn the ropes. Discussions with both Jason and
	Shivangi have been very helpful in organize my thoughts.

	I would like to thank both the SeaQuest and SpinQuest collaborations.
	This study would not be possible with out the tremendous work by all the
	collaborators. Particularly, I would like to thank Dr.~Kiu Liu of Los Almos
	National Lab and Dr.~Rick Tesarek of Fermilab for their help and guidance during
	my time at Fermilab.

	Last and certainly not least, I would like to extend my gratitude to my family
	for support in my pursuit of a Ph.D halfway across the glob, particularly
	during the pandemic.

	This research is supported by National Science Foundation via grant NSF-PHYS1812377.
