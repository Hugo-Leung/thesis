\chapter{SeaQuest Experiment}
\label{ch:seaquest}

\section{Introduction}
SeaQuest is a fixed-target experiment utilizing the \SI{120}{\GeV} proton beam
from the Fermilab Main Injector. Details of the SeaQuest spectrometer can be
found in Ref.\ \cite{aidala2019}. A schematics of the spectrometer is shown in
Fig.\ \ref{fig:spectrometer}. The target system consists of seven
interchangeable targets, including a flask with liquid hydrogen, a flask with
liquid deuterium,an empty flask (vacuum), solid carbon, iron, and tungsten
targets as well as a space with no target (air). The targets are interchanged
periodically to reduce systematic uncertainties in the measured cross section
ratios for different targets.

The spectrometer consists of two magnets and four tracking stations. FMag,
placed \SI{104}{\cm} downstream the target, is a \SI{5}{\m} solid iron magnet
that acts as the beam dump as well as a focusing magnet. It is then followed by
the first tracking stations. Stations 1, 2 and 3 each consists of plastic
scintillator hodoscopes and drift chambers. An open air dipole magnet (KMag) is
placed between station 1 and station 2. The vertical magnetic field from both
magnets bends the muons horizontally, allowing the measurement of the momentum
of the muons. Downstream of station 3, there is a 1 m iron wall acting as a
hadron absorber. Station 4 is located behind the hadron absorber and acts as a
muon identifier. Station 4 consists of a hodoscope array and 4 layers of
proportional tube planes. Tracks that pass through the hadron absorber and
produce hits on station 4 are assumed to be from muons.

\section{Beam}
\pdfmargincomment{A brief description of the beam structure, how the beam intensity
	is monitor. And finally says that the varying instantaneous beam intensity
	allows us to do intensity extrapolation which will be discussed in next
	chapter}
The layout of the Fermilab accelerator complex is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:complex}.
SeaQuest received its \SI{120}{\GeV} proton beam from the Fermilab Main Injector.
The proton beam originate from a direct-extraction magnetron hydrogen ion source,
which produce a \SI{35}{\keV} negative hydrogen ion beam. It is then accelerated
to \SI{750}{\keV} using Radio-frequency Quadrupole. Then the Linac accelrate the
$H^-$ ions to \SI{400}{MeV}. The $H^-$ ions are then sent through a stripping foil
to remove the electrons. The resulting proton beam then circulates in the Booster
accelerator and accelerates to \SI{8}{\GeV}. The \SI{8}{\GeV} proton beam is
further accelerated by the Main Injector to \SI{120}{GeV}. The proton beam is
extracted from the Main Injector using a process known as resonant extraction to
provide a lower intensity beam over a 5 second spill. The extracted beam, which
is sent to SeaQuest, retains the the \SI{53.1}{\MHz} structure of the Main
Injector RF frequency, dividing hte beam in to ``RF buckets'' that are less than
\SI{2}{\ns} long and occur every \SI{18.8}{\ns}

\end{figure}
However the number of protons in each bucket varies greatly during the spill, as
is shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:intensity}.

The beam intensity is monitored using a Cerenkov counter, shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:BIM}.

\end{figure}
This allows us the obtain the yield ratios as a function of the instantaneous
intensity, which will be discussed further in Sec.\ \ref{M-sec:extrapolation}
