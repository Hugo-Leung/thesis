\section{Drell-Yan Cross Section Ratio}
\subsection{Mass fit results}
The two datasets are analyzed separately, and a fit to the mass spectrum is performed separately for each
dataset and each target independently.
The fits to the mass distributions for Run 2-3 data are shown in \cref{fig:massfit_integrated}, and the
data is very well described by the fitting procedure outlined in \cref{M-sec:massfit_procedure}.
Similarly, the mass distributions for Run 5-6 are also shown in \cref{fig:massfit_integrated}.

\end{figure}
With the yields for different processes obtained from the mass fits, 
the cross section ratio as a function of $x_T$ can be calculated following \cref{M-subsec:contamination},
and are shown in \cref{fig:CSR_MF_xT} and tabulated in \cref{tab:DY-MF-x2}.

The extracted cross section ratio from the two datasets are consistent with each other within uncertainties.
The red points in \cref{fig:CSR_MF_xT} represent results from the combined analysis following the procedure in \cref{M-subsec:combine}.

\subsubsection{Effect of the updated target contamination correction}
\label{subsubsec:contamination_result}
As discussed in \cref{M-subsec:contamination}, incorrect target contamination corrections were used
in previous publications and the effect is shown in \cref{fig:contaimination_CSR}.
The overall effect is a roughly \SI{2}{\percent} shift in the ratio. 
This correction only affects the results from Run~2-3 as the later runs utilize commercial pure deuterium.
The updated corrections are used throughout this thesis.

\subsubsection{Cross section ratio vs other variables}
Following a similar procedure, the Drell-Yan cross section ratios as a function of $x_B$ (\cref{fig:CSR_MF_xB})
and $x_F$ (\cref{fig:CSR_MF_xF}) are also extracted, and tabulated in \cref{tab:DY-MF-x1} and \cref{tab:DY-IE-xF} respectively.

\subsection{Comparison with global PDF analysis}
\Cref{fig:e866_e906} shows the comparison of the measured $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ from SeaQuest and NuSea~\cite{towell2001},
as well as calculations using CT18 and NNPDF4.0 PDFs.
The measured ratios from SeaQuest are consistent with both NuSea results and calculations using CT18 PDFs
at low $x_T$. Since the high statistics data at low $x_T$ from NuSea were used to constrain
the CT18 PDFs, the good agreement reflects the consistency between NuSea and SeaQuest results
at the low $x_T$ region. 
In contrast, the SeaQuest results at higher $x_T$ are significantly larger than NuSea results and calculations using CT18 PDFs.
The CT18 PDFs, based on fits that include the NuSea data, show a drop of the cross section
at large $x_T$. No such drop is  observed in the SeaQuest results.
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{DY-csr/E906_E866_xT.pdf}
	\caption{The comparison of the measured $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ cross section ratios as function of $x_T$
		between SeaQuest (red circles) and NuSea (blue triangles)~\cite{towell2001}.
		The curves represent calculations at SeaQuest kinematics.}
	\label{fig:e866_e906}
\end{figure} 

The published $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ ratio result using Run 2-3 data~\cite{dove2021,dove2023}
has been included in various recent global PDF analysis~\cite{cocuzza2021,guzzi2022,accardi2023,alekhin2023}.
In particular, \cref{fig:e866_e906} shows the calculation using CT18 (obtained without the SeaQuest data)
and NNPDF~4.0 (obtained with the SeaQuest data). The shift in the calculated cross section ratio is primarily
coming from the inclusion of the SeaQuest data.
As the NNPDF4.0 analysis were performed with the SeaQuest results in their global analysis,
calculations with NNPDF4.0 PDFs are naturally in better agreement with the SeaQuest results.

The importance of the SeaQuest data can be seen in the NNPDF4.0, where at large $x_T$, the
uncertainty band is consistent with the uncertainties of our measurements, as the SeaQuest
results is the only available data sensitive to the light sea-quark asymmetry at large $x$.
The updated $\sigma_{pd}/2\sigma_{pp}$ ratio from the combined analysis is slightly larger than the NNPDF4.0
calculation, this is partly due to the updated contamination correction, and partly due to the new data.
With the reduced statistical uncertainties from the combined analysis,
the uncertainty on the $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ will be to reduce further.
The impact of the SeaQuest measurement is further illustrated in \cref{fig:JAM_impact}. 
The JAM analysis~\cite{cocuzza2021} found that the SeaQuest measurement greatly reduces the 
uncertainties on the $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ ratio, by up to $\approx 50\%$ at $x>0.3$. 
The addition of the SeaQuest data also constrain the ratio to remain above unity up to values of $x\approx0.4$,
which is also in better agreement with prediction from various models, including meson-cloud and statistical model.

		where the SeaQuest and STAR measurements are excluded in the JAM analysis~\cite{cocuzza2021}.
		The uncertainty on $\bar{d}/\bar{u}$ for these two scenarios normalized to that of the baseline

\subsection{Comparison between Massfit and Intensity Extrapolation Method}
As described in \cref{M-sec:extrapolation}, an independent method for extracting the Drell-Yan cross section
ratio is developed by utilizing its rate dependence. 

\subsubsection{Systematic uncertainties due to choice of fit function}
To understand the systematic uncertainties in the intensity extrapolation method due to the
choice of fit function, the following two fit functions are used.
\begin{align}
	R_i\left(I\right) & = p_{0i} + p_{1} I + p_{2} I^2 \quad\text{(FIT 1)}                                                     \\
	R_i\left(I\right) & = p_{0i} + \left[p_{10} + p_{11}x_i\right] I + \left[p_{20} + p_{21}x_i\right]I^2 \quad \text{(FIT 2)}
	\label{eq:fit_functions}
\end{align}
The fit to data using the two fits for selected $x_T$ bins are shown in \cref{fig:FIT1_selected,fig:FIT2_selected},
and $\chi^2$ for the fits are tabulated in \cref{tab:chi_IE}.
The fit in other $x_T$ bins and for other variables are shown in \cref{M-a_ch:extrapolation}.

\end{figure}

While the difference caused by the fit functions are small for $x_T$ in Run 2-3,
as shown in \cref{fig:CSR_IE_run23} and reported in Ref.~\cite{dove2021},
the difference is significantly larger in the other variables and in Run 5-6, as shown in \cref{fig:CSR_IE_run56}.
This is a major systematic uncertainty in this method. 
In Ref.~\cite{dove2021}, Fit-1 was chosen as the central value, but the reduced $\chi^2$ are very similar between the two fits,
as tabulated in \cref{tab:chi_IE}. 
It should also be noted that during the Run 5-6 data taking, the variation in the instantaneous beam
intensity was reduced as compared to Run 2-3.
This is partly due to the improvement in beam quality and partly due to the tightening of the beam inhibit thresholds.
Therefore, the range of trigger intensity that can be used for the intensity extrapolation is smaller in Run 5-6. 
The smaller range might be partly responsible for the larger systematic uncertainty in the intensity extrapolation method
in Run 5-6.

The comparison of the results from massfit and extrapolation methods are shown in \cref{fig:CSR_method}. 
The results from the two methods mostly agree with each other,
partly due to the larger systematic uncertainties in the extrapolation method,
which is mostly dominated by the difference in the fit function.

The final cross section ratio is obtained by taking the average of the two method and shown in red in \cref{fig:CSR_method}.
The final ratios are tabulated in \cref{tab:DY-final}
