\section{SpinQuest Experiment}

\subsection{Polarized Target}
The polarized target used by SpinQuest has been rebuilt and tested by the 
University of Virginia. The target consists of a \SI{5}{\tesla} superconducting 
split coil magnet, a \ce{^4He}  evaporation refrigerator, a \SI{140}{\GHz} 
microwave source and a \SI{15000}{\cubic\meter\per\hour} pumping system. The 
target is polarized using Dynamic Nuclear Polarization(DNP)\cite{crabb1995}.

\section{Preliminary Result}
\pdfcomment{Hoping we got a mass spectrum from spinquest and possibly comment 
on the enhance jpsi peak due to new trigger road and magnet settings}
