\subsection{Polarized Target}
The polarized target was previously used by EXXX\pdfcomment{which experiment? 
Is it  E143 at SLAC?} It has been rebuilt and tested by the University of 
Virginia group. The target consists of a \SI{5}{\tesla} superconducting 
split coil magnet, a \ce{^4He}  evaporation refrigerator, a \SI{140}{\GHz} 
microwave source and a \SI{15000}{\cubic\meter\per\hour} pumping system. The 
target is polarized using Dynamic Nuclear Polarization(DNP)\cite{crabb1995}.
\pdfcomment{should there be a brief explanation on DNP?}

\subsection{Data Acquisition System}

\section{Preliminary Result}
\pdfcomment{Hoping we got a mass spectrum from spinquest and possibly comment 
	on the enhance jpsi peak due to new trigger road and magnet settings}
